# love2d-css-colors
 
A simple function for LÃ–VE that converts CSS color names to RGB/A. For a full list of CSS colors, see [https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp).
<br>
### Usage
```lua
css(color, alpha)
```

### Example code 
```lua
require("css-colors")

function love.draw()
love.graphics.setColor(css("Green", 1)) --rgba 0, 128, 0, 1
love.graphics.rectangle("fill", 0, 0, 40, 40)
..
end
```


Typing "Grey" instead of "Gray" or vice versa works just fine. You also don't have to give ``alpha`` a value as it is ``1`` by default. So asigning a value to ``alpha`` isn't necessary unless you want to give it a value that isn't equal to ``1``.

If you find any errors or would like to improve the function then you're welcome to make an issue or pull request.
